[Music]

do you want your money or do you don't

want your money then you need to do as i

say

you are not my teacher no no

no no no no no

[Applause]

i've been calling scammers for over

three years now and although i've had

some pretty exciting and interesting

learning experiences and just all around

crazy moments

this has to be the most extreme

raw anger that i have ever witnessed

the entire call took place over a couple

days 10 hours worth of phone calls

and ultimately ended in a pretty

exciting display of anger it started off

like a typical refund scam where they

pose as a company like microsoft

offering to give you money back for

something you purchased

they lock your computer and then pretend

to transfer money

to your bank account you never used our

service at once

but you paid 399 dollars two years back

so we have to refund that money to you

okay

you know sometimes i feel like

life is a lot like chess sometimes you

do

you don't realize that you're just

right now just go ahead and type the

name of

your why do i have to go to my bank

uh you don't have to give me any of your

personal information you don't need to

worry about it

as this call has been recorded for the

policing purposes

right you just need to go ahead and

accept the money transfer what we are

going to do that's it

if you tell any of your personal details

over this call

i might lose my job because i am dealing

with you and we have some protocols

which we need to follow

oh gosh well i'll be sure not to say

anything personal then

yeah i wouldn't want you to lose your

job there that would be

that would be bad thank you your

computer is acting

like really weird sometimes you know

oh

i think this guy is very suspicious uh

he tried to do

a bank right he tried to log in like

without any credentials and stuff

yeah why

okay do you have a username and a

password

um well i can't give you any personal

information over the phone

i understand you need not tell me

anything all right

after you log in just let me know do not

tell me anything

just give me a second

working on you i'm working on your case

only and i'm not touching any other

customer

okay just bear with me

oh okay

sorry i'm just not familiar with the how

these things work

i'll keep quiet just go ahead and write

down the available balance of your

account okay you want me to write down

okay

yes yes so that after i give you the

money you can

you know by adding it up you can always

proceed that if you have received the

money or not

i could just write down the balance of

this everything

with this paper and before i hang on

out of curiosity by a raise

how many of you have been expecting

money into your bank account

and the way that you verify whether or

not you got it is by

writing down your previous balance

account

how many because i've never done that i

just look at the transaction history

while scammers are on your computer they

often use something like this to hide

your screen

and then they'll transfer money in

between your accounts or edit the html

to make it look like

you have more money than you're supposed

to it's all part of their tricks up

some coffee for my husband when he gets

back

he likes it he likes it extra sloppy

i understand do you ever put eggs in

your coffee

never it's like a quick way to eat

breakfast you know

you get it all done all at once just put

a raw egg in there

a little mayonnaise whip it up

all right

your money is 260 000 correct which is

not

there right but my money is forty

thousand dollars

all right oh the four hundred the forty

thousand dollars

went to mine okay

if you give me two hundred and twenty

thousand dollars back

that's how basic math works do you

understand that

60 minus 20

no

minus 40.

20 great

so you give me 220 000

back which means you'll be keeping

your forty thousand dollars

bank

why did you redeem it why did you redeem

it

steve i'm gonna let me just teach you

something a lot of kids don't understand

this

when you say something and someone

doesn't understand it

you should try saying something

differently next time

if you say the same thing over and over

expecting a different result

not very happy one of the things that

you want to do

sometimes you have to use your brain a

little bit

so why don't you ask me that question

differently

so i understand you okay okay now you

understand something

the cards which you have used is

worthless now

okay the cards which you have redeemed

or else you lose

[Music]

clearly

you can't you can't

you just see what i can do you are an

evil

why did you why did you why did you use

my cards

lost it

you lost your self-control you've gone a

little bit in

maybe a little a little crazy there

honey

you and i both know that you just

need some money you're not going to hurt

anybody

you don't want to go to jail why did you

do it

shallow

the shallow way okay you want it you

want the things to be okay

you want the things to be

i want card right now you need to go to

different store

you need to go to a different store and

buy

me target gift card what card will you

think so highly of themselves and who

has claimed
